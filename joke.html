<p>So, I don't actually have a Twitter. I just thought it looked awkward with only 2 logos at the bottom of my page.</p>
<p>I know I'm not going to link my anonymous social media accounts. As funny as I think I am, and others think I am. I'm not going to link it here.</p>
<p>Unless I got wildly successful as a comedian.</p>
